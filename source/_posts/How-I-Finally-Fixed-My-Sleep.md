Despite the drawbacks of sleeping (preadetor attacks, loss of productivity etc) we know that because it's survived the evevoluntanry process, we know that it performs critical functions.

We know that the body performs these biological functions whilst we sleep:
    * **Celluar Restoration**, the body uses the period of sleep to repair damaged cells.
    * **Brain Function**, sleep allows the nurons in your brain to reorganise, clean out toxic byproducts  using the glymphatic system and memory function by converting short-term memories into long term and [forgetting uneeded information.] [1]
    * **Other functions** - Sleep also has an effect on your Heart health, Emotion, Weight, Immunity amoung others 

 The cycle between sleeping Ã§and wakefulness is generally controlled by two things:
    - Your circadian Rhythm - your internal (Cellular) body clock.
